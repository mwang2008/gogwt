GoGWT is the demo site to use GWT.

= Foreword / How to read this doc =
This document was written for developers who have worked with Java before and want to start developing GWT application and/or who already work on GWT and try to tune up the GWT application to run with high performance.

During the last two years, I have been working as a lead consultant/architecture to prototype, layout the framework, design and implement high traffic (multiple million traffic hits per day), high volume and high competitive, multi-language website with GWT.

I try to turn on the reading of this doc to be more hands on experience and will provide examples, some with in details.  Also, I will list few real world difficulties/challenges regarding the design and implementation and how to address them.
